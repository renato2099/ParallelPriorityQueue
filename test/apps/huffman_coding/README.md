 A Huffman code is an optimal prefix code found using the algorithm developed by David A. Huffman. The process of finding and/or using such a code is called Huffman coding and is a common technique in entropy encoding, including in lossless data compression. The algorithm's output can be viewed as a variable-length code table for encoding a source symbol (such as a character in a file). Huffman's algorithm derives this table based on the estimated probability or frequency of occurrence (weight) for each possible value of the source symbol. --> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding
