\begin{abstract}
%Describe in concise words what you do, why you do it (not necessarily
%in this order), and the main result.  The abstract has to be
%self-contained and readable for a person in the general area. You
%should write the abstract last.

	\begin{itemize}
	  \item Something about priority queues e.g. use cases, importance.
	  \item Why are there different implementations e.g. parallel vs concurrent, cpu vs gpu
	  \item Our proposed method and why we thought it was a good idea
	  \item Experiences while porting it into a MIC architecture
	\end{itemize}
