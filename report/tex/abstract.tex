\begin{abstract}

A priority queue appears in various multithreading applications.
However, an efficient implementation for a concurrent priority queue is challenging in practice, since already proposed mutual exclusion strategies cause blocking and have bad scalability.

We present a lock-free implementation for a concurrent priority queue which is based on a single atomic synchronization primitive that is available on every common CPU.
The underlying data structure is a skip list and supports the \textit{deleteMin} operation in $\Theta(1)$ time.

We conducted experiments on Xeon CPU and Xeon Phi, by comparing the lock-free implementation with the TBB concurrent priority queue, and two different implementations using mutual exclusion.
The experimental results show that the \textit{deleteMin} operation of our implementation is faster than that of the other implementations thanks to better time complexity.


%Describe in concise words what you do, why you do it (not necessarily
%in this order), and the main result.  The abstract has to be
%self-contained and readable for a person in the general area. You
%should write the abstract last.

%	\begin{itemize}
%	  \item Something about priority queues e.g. use cases, importance.
%	  \item Why are there different implementations e.g. parallel vs concurrent, cpu vs gpu
%	  \item Our proposed method and why we thought it was a good idea
%	  \item Experiences while porting it into a MIC architecture
