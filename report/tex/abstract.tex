A priority queue appears in various multithreading applications.
%TODO . Being a challenge in practice has nothing to with mutual exclusion strategies
However, an efficient implementation for a concurrent priority queue is challenging in practice, since already proposed mutual exclusion strategies cause blocking and have bad scalability.\\
We present a lock-free implementation of a concurrent priority queue which only makes use of atomic operations which are present in most modern x86 CPUs.
The underlying data structure is a skip list enabling lookups in $\Theta(\log(n))$ and \textit{pop} operations in $\Theta(1)$ time complexity.\\
Experiments were conducted on a Xeon CPU and a Xeon Phi, we evaluated the difference between those platforms and also in comparison to different baseline implementations, e.g. Intel TBB priority queue [REF].
The experimental results show that our lock-free implementation is competitive against other implementations and even surpasses the baseline implementations in certain operations.
