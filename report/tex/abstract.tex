A priority queue appears in various multithreading applications.
%TODO . Being a challenge in practice has nothing to with mutual exclusion strategies
However, an efficient implementation for a concurrent priority queue is challenging in practice, since already proposed mutual exclusion strategies cause blocking and have bad scalability.

We present a lock-free implementation for a concurrent priority queue which is based on a single atomic synchronization primitive available on every common CPU.
The underlying data structure is a skip list enabling the \textit{pop} operation to be performed in $\Theta(1)$ time.

%TODO Xeon CPU or i7?

We conducted experiments on Xeon CPU and Xeon Phi, by comparing our lock-free implementation with Intel TBB concurrent priority queue, and two different implementations using mutual exclusion.
The experimental results show that our lock-free implementation is competitive against other implemenentations due to a better time complexity in the \textit{pop} operation and its non-blocking design.
%The experimental results show that the \textit{pop} operation of our implementation is faster than that of the other implementations thanks to better time complexity.
