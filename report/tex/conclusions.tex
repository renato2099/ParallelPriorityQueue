\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:con}
We presented a lock-free concurrent priority queue based on a skip list. The implementation was evaluated on a common x86 CPU and more interesting on a MIC architecture, the Xeon Phi. The results show that our implementation is competitive in comparison to the assessed baseline implementations. On the MIC architecture, all tested implementations are below our expectations because they are unable to take advantage of this modern hardware architecture. Further optimizations specifically for the MIC architecture are necessary to achieve expected performance.
