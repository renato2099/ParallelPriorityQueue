\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:con}
%Here you need to summarize what you did and why this is important. {\em Do not take the abstract} and put it in the past tense. Remember, now the reader has (hopefully) read the paper, so it is a very different situation from the abstract. Try to highlight important results and say the things you really want to get across such as high-level statements (e.g., we believe that .... is the right approach to .... Even though we only considered the DFT, the .... technique should be applicable ....) You can also formulate next steps if you want. Be brief



We presented lock-free concurrent priority queue based on a skip list. The implementation was evaluated on a common x86 CPU and especially on a Xeon Phi MIC. The results showed that our implementation is competitive but suffers many cache-invalidations. This is a characteristic of a lock-free implementation since they guarantee progress but as a trade-off threads.
