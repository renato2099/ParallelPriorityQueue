\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:con}
We presented a lock-free concurrent priority queue based on a skip list. The implementation was evaluated on a common x86 CPU and more importantly on a Xeon Phi MIC. The results show that our implementation is competitive in comparison to asses baseline implementations. On the MIC architecture, all tested implementations are below our expectations and are unable to take advantage of the hardware. Our lock-free implementation suffers mostly from the overhead due to the cache-consistency protocol.
