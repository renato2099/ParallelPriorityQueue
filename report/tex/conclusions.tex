We presented lock-free concurrent priority queue based on a skip list. The implementation was evaluated on a common x86 CPU and especially on a Xeon Phi MIC. The results showed that our implementation is competitive but suffers many cache-invalidations. This is a characteristic of a lock-free implementation since they guarantee progress but as a trade-off threads.
